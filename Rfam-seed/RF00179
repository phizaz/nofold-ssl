#=GF CC   This family represents a cis-acting element in the 3'-UTR of the
#=GF CC   ceruloplasmin (Cp) gene called gamma interferon inhibitor of translation
#=GF CC   (GAIT). The GAIT element is involved in selective translational
#=GF CC   silencing of the Cp transcript. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multifunctional,
#=GF CC   copper-containing glycoprotein produced by the liver and secreted into
#=GF CC   the plasma. As an acute-phase protein, its plasma concentration can
#=GF CC   double during multiple inflammatory conditions. Plasma Cp has been
#=GF CC   reported to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
#=GF CC   including atherosclerosis, carotid restenosis after endarterectomy, and
#=GF CC   myocardial infarction. Translational silencing of Cp, and
#=GF CC   possibly other transcripts, mediated by the GAIT element may contribute to
#=GF CC   the resolution of the local inflammatory response following cytokine
#=GF CC   activation of macrophages [1].
